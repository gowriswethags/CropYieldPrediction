# Crop Yield Prediction using Random Forest

This repository provides a machine learning model that predicts crop yield based on various features, such as soil type, crop type, region, and previous crop. Leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, the model achieves high accuracy, is resilient to missing data and outliers, and identifies key factors that impact yield.

## Features
- **Random Forest Algorithm**: Robust, ensemble-based model well-suited for regression tasks like crop yield prediction.
- **Data Handling**: Processes categorical features and handles missing data and outliers effectively.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) for performance assessment.

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install these with:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn


### 2. Clone the Repository
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-yield-prediction.git
cd crop-yield-prediction


### 3. Run the Model
Load Data: Place your dataset (e.g., crop_yield_data.csv) in the project folder.
Train the Model: Run the main script to train the model:

python app1.py
Evaluate the Model: Model metrics (MSE, MAE, R²) will be displayed to assess accuracy.


### 4. Save and Load Model
The trained model is saved as crop_yield_model.pkl for future use.

Project Structure
app1.py: Main script for training and evaluating the model.
crop_yield_data.csv: Sample dataset (if provided).
